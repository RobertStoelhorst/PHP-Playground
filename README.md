**_ Merge to the main branch to deploy _**
I have integrated this github repo with my Heroku account.
In the heroku project webapp configuration I have set up automatic deployments from the main branch, so any merges to main will start a production build and deploy process.
All development work should be done in the Dev branch and tested locally for now.
